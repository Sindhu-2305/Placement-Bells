          Once the first four rounds are done, your HR round comes into the picture.
As a candidate, here you are supposed to give a brief introduction, 
answer a few HR interview questions and answers about your job role or career and in the end, 
discuss salary, benefits, company rules conditions etc., with the HR.
Getting nervous is perfectly human, but how to ensure that the answers that you are about to give are smart enough 
and will lead to selection?
To help you, we have gathered some of the website links which you can use while preparing for an interview .<br>
 Give a glance before you attend your interview.
